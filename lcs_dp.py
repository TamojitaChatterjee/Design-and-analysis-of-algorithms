#longest common subsequence
'''
A subsequence is a part of a string where characters appear in the same order, but not necessarily next to each other.
For example, in the string ABCDEFG, ABEF is a subsequence but BAD isnâ€™t.
The LCS problem requires us to find the length of the longest subsequence that exists in both strings.
